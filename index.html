                <h2>Happy 19th Birthday!</h2>
                <p>My dearest bestie, So Panha</p>
                <p>Honestly it's wild that you’re 19 already, but also… it fits(you're old). You’ve grown so much and I’m proud of you in ways I don’t even say out loud enough. Life hasn’t always been easy, but you still show up, still care, still try — and that says everything about you.

Thank you for being my go-to person: for the random laughs, the deep talks at midnight, the “I need you right now” moments, and the memories that live rent-free in my head. You make everything more fun just by being there, and I genuinely don’t know what I’d do without you.

I hope 19 treats you better, brings you new wins, soft moments, loud laughs, and everything you deserve (and maybe a little chaos for character development). Keep being you — kind, strong, hilarious, and effortlessly special.

No matter what, I’ve always got your back.</p>
                <p>Happy birthday to the future Doctor.</p>
                <p>Always,</p>
                <p>With love, Liza Phat</p>
